# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository! 🚀  

This repository is dedicated to my daily practice of solving problems and mastering concepts in DSA. By consistently practicing, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills and strengthen my knowledge of core programming concepts.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
The repository includes solutions and notes on the following topics (more will be added as I progress):
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Hashing**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **String Manipulation**

## 📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

📦 DSA-Practice ├── 📂 Arrays ├── 📂 Linked_Lists ├── 📂 Stacks_Queues ├── 📂 Trees ├── 📂 Graphs ├── 📂 Dynamic_Programming ├── 📂 Sorting_Searching ├── 📂 Strings ├──


Each folder contains:
1. Problem statements.
2. Solution files (in Python/C++/Java).
3. Explanations and complexity analysis (if applicable).

---

## 🛠️ Languages Used
- Python 🐍
- C++ 💻
- Java ☕

---

## 🔄 Daily Practice Plan
1. Solve **at least one problem** every day.
2. Focus on a specific topic for a few days before moving to the next.
3. Revise previously solved problems regularly.
4. Experiment with solutions in different programming languages for versatility.

---

## 🚧 Future Goals
- Complete at least **100 problems** within the next 3 months.
- Participate in online coding contests (e.g., Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank).
- Create a detailed guide for each data structure and algorithm.
